# FX-RFQ-Front-Running-Detection-Using-Python
Developed a PySpark-based compliance monitoring system to detect front-running in FX RFQ workflows. The solution analyzes RFQs, dealer trades, and market benchmarks using YAML-driven alert rules for pre-trade activity, quote deviation, latency, and execution quality, producing risk scores and audit-ready outputs.
